//We begin constructing the component by defining it in one of two ways.
// Where possible it's preferable to use functiopn expressions as components. These are called Pure components. A key feature of Pure components is that they do not have State.

// If we require state then we define the component as a Class component. We create a class which extends the 'Component' prototype provided by React. The Component prototype contains the key methods and features required for the component to work in its very specific manner.

// NB: Technically functional components -can- have state these days, since a React update added a feature for this. A feature called React Hooks is used for this. But use of classes is the established method that most companies continue to use, according to my current course. So it's required knowledge. 

//See Footnote 1 for the syntax.
class App extends Component {

//Here we define the component's State, an Object containing parameters.
//If anything in a component's State is changed while the app is rendered, React will update that component in the DOM; so it will update the page.
//While Props are passed down the component tree to children, State is configured within the component itself.

    //this.state.persons[0].name = 'Dave'
    // React does NOT allow this kind of direct mutation of state. Instead we use a special method which merges new content with the existing state, and lets React know about it so it can update the DOM appropriately:
    this.setState({

      ]
    })
    // This only updates the specified bit of state, and it only updates that part of the DOM. Only changing state and/or changing props causes these kind of real-time DOM updates, as I currently understand it.

///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
//Footnote 1: Using React Hooks
/*

//We need to import the useState method from React at the top of the js file. This is an example of a Hook. Other hooks exist and will be used later.

import React, { useState} from 'react'

//On to creating the component! We define the component as a functional component.

  const App = props => {

// We use the useState hook to define the initial state of the component.
// UseState returns an array with -exactly two- elements:
  // The first element is the current state. (I've popped an additional variable in here for a demo further down these notes).
  // The second element is a function that can update the first element and re-render it. We can call this to update the state. Nifty!
// We can store this in a constant.

    const stateArray = useState({
      persons: [
        { name: 'David', age: 25 },
        { name: 'Pablo', age: 28 },
        { name: 'Dani', age: 26 }
      ],
      sameAddress: true,
    });

// Oh, but we can go a step further! We can use Array Destructuring to attach these elements to variables, so that we can call them easily. Array destructuring is like object destructuring; `const [  element1, element2] = array`.

    const [personsState, setPersonsState] = useState({
      persons: [
        { name: 'David', age: 25 },
        { name: 'Pablo', age: 28 },
        { name: 'Dani', age: 26 }
      ]
    });

// We also include the switch name handler function in the functional component. Looks strange, but it's just fine for building functional components using React hooks.

// There are two semantic differences here compared to the Class based component. 
  // We no longer need to use the 'this.' keyword to call things from whtihin thic omponent. Classes need to use 'this.', so class based components need to use 'this.'. However functional components are functions,a nd these can call their own properties using just the property's name.
  // Previously we changed the state using this.setState. Now we use the  setPersonsState method from the destructured useState expression above, and pass the new state into it.
// There is also a SUPER IMPORTANT FUNCTIONAL DIFFERENCE.
  // The setPersonsState method (or whatever we call the new Set State method) DOES NOT MERGE THE NEW STATE DATA WITH THE OLD STATE DATA. It REPLACES it. The old data is deleted and the new data replaces it. As such, you need to include ALL required data in the new data set. You can't just add one piece to a set and expect the other pieces to remain as they were.
  // One time-saving approach to this is to reference the old state data in the new Set State call. An example is below; we pass the existing value of sameAddress into the new state dataset.

    const switchNameHandler = () => {
      useState({
        persons: [
          { name: 'Andy', age: 25 },
          { name: 'Carlos', age: 28 },
          { name: 'Carley', age: 26 }
        ],
        sameAddress: personsState.sameAddress
      })
    }


// An alternative approach to this State issue is to call useState multiple times to define a number of seperate State variables, and to update them individually as required. This is totally acceptable and can be a more elegant solution. Further, the State entities don't have to be objects; they can be any type of variable that we need.

//In the example below the Persons state and Address state are stored as seperate State entities. personsState is an object containing an array, as previously. addressState is an object containing one property. It could be anything else we like; an array, a string, whatever.

// When we then update the state of the `personsState` state entity using the switchNameHandler method (we defined this a while ago using desctructuring, above), we don't modify the `sameAddress` state object. 


    const personsState = useState({
      persons: [
        { name: 'David', age: 25 },
        { name: 'Pablo', age: 28 },
        { name: 'Dani', age: 26 }
      ],
    });

    const addressState = useState({
      sameAddress: true,
    })

    const switchNameHandler = () => {
      setPersonsState({
        persons: [
          {name: 'Andy', age: 25}
          { name: 'Carlos', age: 28 },
          { name: 'Carley', age: 26 }
        ]
      })
    }
  



// The Render part of the component is basically the same, but again we don't need to use .this where we did previously and we access the destructured `personsState` rather than `this.state` when providing some values.

    render() {
      return (
        <div className="App">
         <h1>Hi! I'm a React app!</h1>
         <button onClick={switchNameHandler}>Switch Name</button>
         <Person name={personsState.persons[0].name} age={personsState.persons[0].age} />
         <Person name={personsState.persons[1].name} age={personsState.persons[1].age} />
         <Person name={personsState.persons[2].name} age={personsState.persons[2].age}>
           <p>This text is a child of a Perosn component. Children can be passed to a component using the reserved word 'children'.</p>
           <p>You can pass in a ton of structured HTML using props.children.</p> 
        </Person>
        </div>
      );
   }
